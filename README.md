# Regiment Lite Adventures

![Regiment Banner](banner.png)

> **Lightweight • Vanilla+ • Official Regiment Gaming Community Pack**

The perfect balance of vanilla Minecraft with just enough quality-of-life polish to make everything feel smooth, fair, and fun.  
No new dimensions, no tech trees, no overhauls. Only small, rock-solid enhancements.

Regiment Lite Adventures is a hand-crafted modpack for the Regiment Gaming Community. It brings together a carefully chosen set of QoL, performance, and decorative mods that enhance Minecraft without ever changing the core experience you know and love.  
It improves performance, simplifies inventory management, adds subtle visual polish, and keeps FPS high; all while staying beginner-friendly and true to vanilla.

- **Mod count**: ~79 hand-picked mods  
- Runs beautifully on machines that can already handle vanilla
